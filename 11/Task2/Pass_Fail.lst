                        ; Purpose:      The purpose of the Pass_Fail_Subroutine is to
                        ;               determine if the supplied integer is a Pass or a Fail, given:
                        ;               - a Pass is >= 5
                        ;               - a Fail is < 5
                        ;               and return a Pass or Fail indication
                        
                        ; Precondition:  Register X contains value to check for pass or fail
                        ;
                        ; Postcondition: Overwrite accumulator A with either 0 or 1
                        ;                0 Indicates that the mark was fail
                        ;                1 indicate that the mark was pass
